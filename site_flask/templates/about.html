<h1>About Project Double-Down</h1>
<p>For the first few years of my professional career, I have been a "Automation Consultant", which basically means people in the company show me a crappy manual process, and I design something to make it faster and less prone to errors. This is a highly specialized role only available to people who are a little bit better with technology than the average joe. I've made tons of VBA macros, Excel tools, Power Apps, Power BI reports, chatbots for Teams, and RPA automations using UiPath. All of these have been awesome to learn and fun to play around with, but I wanted some experience that would set me apart from my peers in terms of technical prowess. Python is ALL the rage right now for me, so I knew that was what I wanted to pick up.</p>
<p>I've always been at my most-motivated when there is a specific objective I align with. Sadly, online modules like HackerRank, Leetcode, and even the Duo-Lingo clone for learning programming "Mimo" didn't keep my attention. So, I decided that I needed a challenge that I could continuously chip away at. I figured that a great chance to dip my toes into python would be a simple script that follows set procedures. Wouldn't you know it, I also happen to be a fan of casinos, and the game of Blackjack in particular. The writing was on the wall, and I hit the ground running in hopes of writing a python script that would accurately simulate a hand of Blacjack between the player (user) and the dealer (computer, since the dealer in a game of Blackjack is bound to a specific set of actions depending on the casino's preferred ruleset). This was going to make it super easy to create, and once I had it made I was hooked.</p>
<p>Now that I have the script working to play a single hand of Blackjack over and over, the mind began to wander and I looked to the stars to see where I could take it next. I've always had a "stick it to the man" kind of attitude, and fantasized about learning to count cards at the Blackjack table to bring down the house. However, this takes a shitload of practice and muscle memory, which are two things I don't have and are not easy to come by. Some card-counting training programs will run you over $400/year if you are serious about it, but what if you're like me? The "hobbyist that wants the financial freedom to pick up card counting and train seriously for howver long or short of a stint they desire" shouldn't have to pay $400 a year.</p>
<p>So thats it. The goal of this project is to one day have a freestanding site that will train you to count cards and learn basic strategy in the game of Blackjack, without breaking your bank. Follow along on my LinkedIn below to see how updates are coming along. Now leave me alone</p>
